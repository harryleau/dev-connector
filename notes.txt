////////// USING PASSPORT - JWT
1. install passport, passport-jwt to use jwt strategy
2. use jwt in users/login route to sign the token for access to private routes
3. initialize passport and add config through a config file.
4. In config file, if opts array (secretOrKey,jwtFromRequest) is passed correctly, it will return the payload of user data (jwt_payload)
5. Then, we can add middleware function of passport to routes that need authentication.
6. To test it out, use postman, fill in email and password, pass token into the Authorization in request Headers.
